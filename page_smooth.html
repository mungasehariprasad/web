          The sand deposit may extend well inland from the berm crest, where
          there may be evidence of one or more older crests (the storm beach)
          resulting from very large storm waves and beyond the influence of the
          normal waves. At some point the influence of the waves (even storm
          waves) on the material comprising the beach stops, and if the
          particles are small enough (sand size or smaller), winds shape the
          feature.

          The composition of the beach depends upon the nature and quantity of
          sediments upstream of the beach, and the speed of flow and turbidity
          of water and wind. Sediments are moved by moving water and wind
          according to their particle size and state of compaction. Particles
          tend to settle and compact in still water. Once compacted, they are
          more resistant to erosion

          systems will tend to hold only large rocks as smaller particles will
          be held in suspension in the turbid water column and carried to calmer
          areas by longshore currents and tides. Coastlines that are protected
          from waves and winds will tend to allow finer sediments such as clay
          and mud to precipitate creating mud flats and mangrove forests. The
          shape of a beach depends on whether the waves are constructive or
          destructive, and whether the material is sand or shingle. Waves are
          constructive if the period between their wave crests is long enough
          for the breaking water to recede and the sediment to settle before the
          succeeding wave arrives and breaks.
